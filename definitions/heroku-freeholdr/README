The following manual steps were taken once Veewee built the VM:

1. Adjust postgresql.conf file to increase memory usage:
   shared_buffers = 128MB
   work_mem = 4MB
   maintenance_work_mem = 25MB 
   checkpoint_segments = 16
2. Adjust postgresql.conf to set listen_address = '*'
3. Adjust pg_hba.conf and do the following:
   1. Comment out this line:
      host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
   2. Add this line at bottom:
      host     all             all            0.0.0.0/0               trust
